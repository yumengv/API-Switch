# Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models REST API reference - Microsoft Foundry | Microsoft Learn

This article provides details on the inference REST API endpoints for Azure OpenAI.

## API specs

Managing and interacting with Azure OpenAI models and resources is divided across three primary API surfaces:

- Control plane
- Data plane - authoring
- Data plane - inference

Each API surface/specification encapsulates a different set of Azure OpenAI capabilities. Each API has its own unique set of preview and stable/generally available (GA) API releases. Preview releases currently tend to follow a monthly cadence.

Important

There is now a new preview inference API. Learn more in our [API lifecycle guide](api-version-lifecycle#api-evolution).

| API | Latest preview release | Latest GA release | Specifications | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Control plane** | `2025-07-01-preview` | [`2025-06-01`](/en-us/rest/api/aifoundry/accountmanagement/operation-groups?view=rest-aifoundry-accountmanagement-2025-06-01&amp;preserve-view=true) | [Spec files](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/cognitiveservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/stable/2025-06-01/cognitiveservices.json) | The control plane API is used for operations like [creating resources](/en-us/rest/api/aifoundry/accountmanagement/accounts/create?view=rest-aifoundry-accountmanagement-2025-06-01&amp;tabs=HTTP&amp;preserve-view=true), [model deployment](/en-us/rest/api/aifoundry/accountmanagement/deployments/create-or-update?view=rest-aifoundry-accountmanagement-2025-06-01&amp;tabs=HTTP&amp;preserve-view=true), and other higher level resource management tasks. The control plane also governs what is possible to do with capabilities like Azure Resource Manager, Bicep, Terraform, and Azure CLI. |
| **Data plane** | [`v1 preview`](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/reference-preview-latest) | [`v1`](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/latest) | [Spec files](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/ai/data-plane/OpenAI.v1) | The data plane API controls inference and authoring operations. |

## Authentication

Azure OpenAI provides two methods for authentication. You can use either API Keys or Microsoft Entra ID.

- **API Key authentication**: For this type of authentication, all API requests must include the API Key in the `api-key` HTTP header. The [Quickstart](how-to/responses) provides guidance for how to make calls with this type of authentication.
- **Microsoft Entra ID authentication**: You can authenticate an API call using a Microsoft Entra token. Authentication tokens are included in a request as the `Authorization` header. The token provided must be preceded by `Bearer`, for example `Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`. You can read our how-to guide on [authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID](../../foundry-classic/openai/how-to/managed-identity).

### REST API versioning

The service APIs are versioned using the `api-version` query parameter. All versions follow the YYYY-MM-DD date structure. For example:

```http
POST https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME/chat/completions?api-version=2024-06-01
```

## Data plane inference

The rest of the article covers the GA release of the Azure OpenAI data plane inference specification, `2024-10-21`.

If you're looking for documentation on the latest preview API release, refer to the [latest preview data plane inference API](reference-preview)

## Completions

```HTTP
POST https://{endpoint}/openai/deployments/{deployment-id}/completions?api-version=2024-10-21
```

Creates a completion for the provided prompt, parameters, and chosen model.

### URI Parameters

| Name | In | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| endpoint | path | Yes | stringurl | Supported Azure OpenAI endpoints (protocol and hostname, for example: `https://aoairesource.openai.azure.com`. Replace "aoairesource" with your Azure OpenAI resource name). https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com |
| deployment-id | path | Yes | string | Deployment ID of the model which was deployed. |
| api-version | query | Yes | string | API version |

### Request Header

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| api-key | True | string | Provide Azure OpenAI API key here |

### Request Body

**Content-Type**: application/json

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prompt | string or array | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.Note that &lt;|endoftext|&gt; is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt isn't specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document. | Yes |  |
| best\_of | integer | Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed.When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return â€“ `best_of` must be greater than `n`.**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`. | No | 1 |
| echo | boolean | Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion | No | False |
| frequency\_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. | No | 0 |
| logit\_bias | object | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token from being generated. | No | None |
| logprobs | integer | Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the five most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5. | No | None |
| max\_tokens | integer | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the completion.The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` can't exceed the model's context length. | No | 16 |
| n | integer | How many completions to generate for each prompt.**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`. | No | 1 |
| presence\_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. | No | 0 |
| seed | integer | If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.Determinism isn't guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. | No |  |
| stop | string or array | Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence. | No |  |
| stream | boolean | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. | No | False |
| suffix | string | The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.This parameter is only supported for `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`. | No | None |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. | No | 1 |
| top\_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. | No | 1 |
| user | string | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help to monitor and detect abuse. | No |  |

### Request Body

**Content-Type**: application/json

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. | No | 1 |
| top\_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. | No | 1 |
| stream | boolean | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. | No | False |
| stop | string or array | Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. | No |  |
| max\_tokens | integer | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. | No |  |
| max\_completion\_tokens | integer | An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens. | No |  |
| presence\_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. | No | 0 |
| frequency\_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. | No | 0 |
| logit\_bias | object | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. | No | None |
| user | string | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help to monitor and detect abuse. | No |  |
| messages | array | A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. | Yes |  |
| data\_sources | array | The configuration entries for Azure OpenAI chat extensions that use them. This additional specification is only compatible with Azure OpenAI. | No |  |
| logprobs | boolean | Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`. | No | False |
| top\_logprobs | integer | An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used. | No |  |
| n | integer | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you'll be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs. | No | 1 |
| parallel\_tool\_calls | ParallelToolCalls | Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use. | No | True |
| response\_format | ResponseFormatText or ResponseFormatJsonObject or ResponseFormatJsonSchema | An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo-models), [GPT-4o mini](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo-models), [GPT-4 Turbo](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo-models) and all [GPT-3.5](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#gpt-35) Turbo models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which guarantees the model will match your supplied JSON schema.Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length. | No |  |
| seed | integer | This feature is in Beta.If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.Determinism isn't guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. | No |  |
| tools | array | A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported. | No |  |
| tool\_choice | chatCompletionToolChoiceOption | Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model won't call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool. `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present. | No |  |
| function\_call | string or chatCompletionFunctionCallOption | Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.`none` means the model won't call a function and instead generates a message.`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present. | No |  |
| functions | array | Deprecated in favor of `tools`.A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. | No |  |

### chatCompletionsRequestCommon

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. | No | 1 |
| top\_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. | No | 1 |
| stream | boolean | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. | No | False |
| stop | string or array | Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. | No |  |
| max\_tokens | integer | The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return will be (4096 - prompt tokens). This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and isn't compatible with o1 series models. | No | 4096 |
| max\_completion\_tokens | integer | An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens. | No |  |
| presence\_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. | No | 0 |
| frequency\_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. | No | 0 |
| logit\_bias | object | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. | No |  |
| user | string | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help Azure OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. | No |  |

### createCompletionRequest

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prompt | string or array | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.Note that &lt;|endoftext|&gt; is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt isn't specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document. | Yes |  |
| best\_of | integer | Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed.When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return â€“ `best_of` must be greater than `n`.**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`. | No | 1 |
| echo | boolean | Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion | No | False |
| frequency\_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. | No | 0 |
| logit\_bias | object | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token from being generated. | No | None |
| logprobs | integer | Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the five most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5. | No | None |
| max\_tokens | integer | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the completion.The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` can't exceed the model's context length. | No | 16 |
| n | integer | How many completions to generate for each prompt.**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`. | No | 1 |
| presence\_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. | No | 0 |
| seed | integer | If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.Determinism isn't guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. | No |  |
| stop | string or array | Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence. | No |  |
| stream | boolean | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. | No | False |
| suffix | string | The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.This parameter is only supported for `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`. | No | None |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. | No | 1 |
| top\_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. | No | 1 |
| user | string | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help to monitor and detect abuse. | No |  |

Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length. | No |  |
| seed | integer | This feature is in Beta.If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.Determinism isn't guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. | No |  |

| tool\_choice | chatCompletionToolChoiceOption | Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model won't call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool. `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present. | No |  |
| function\_call | string or chatCompletionFunctionCallOption | Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.`none` means the model won't call a function and instead generates a message.`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present. | No |  |
